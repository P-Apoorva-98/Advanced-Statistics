Problem 1: 
An independent research organization is trying to estimate the probability that an accident at a nuclear power plant will result in radiation leakage. The types of accidents possible at the plant are, fire hazards, mechanical failure, or human error. The research organization also knows that two or more types of accidents cannot occur simultaneously.

According to the studies carried out by the organization, the probability of a radiation leak in case of a fire is 20%, the probability of a radiation leak in case of a mechanical 50%, and the probability of a radiation leak in case of a human error is 10%. The studies also showed the following;

The probability of a radiation leak occurring simultaneously with fire is 0.1%.
The probability of a radiation leak occurring simultaneously with a mechanical failure is 0.15%.
The probability of a radiation leak occurring simultaneously with a human error is 0.12%.
On the basis of the information available, answer the questions below:

1.1 What are the probabilities of a fire, a mechanical failure, and a human error respectively?

1.2 What is the probability of a radiation leak?

1.3 Suppose there has been a radiation leak in the reactor for which the definite cause is not known. What is the probability that it has been caused by:

a) a fire?

b) a mechanical failure?

c) a human error?

 

Problem 2:
Grades of the final examination in a training course are found to be normally distributed, with a mean of 77 and a standard deviation of 8.5. Based on the given information answer the questions below.

2.1 What is the probability that a randomly chosen student gets a grade below 85 on this exam?

2.2 What is the probability that a randomly selected student scores between 65 and 87?

2.3 What should be the passing cut-off so that 75% of the students clear the exam?

Problem 3:
Business Context
The advent of e-news, or electronic news, portals has offered us a great opportunity to quickly get updates on the day-to-day events occurring globally. The information on these portals is retrieved electronically from online databases, processed using a variety of software, and then transmitted to the users. There are multiple advantages of transmitting news electronically, like faster access to the content and the ability to utilize different technologies such as audio, graphics, video, and other interactive elements that are either not being used or arenâ€™t common yet in traditional newspapers.

E-news Express, an online news portal, aims to expand its business by acquiring new subscribers. With every visitor to the website taking certain actions based on their interest, the company plans to analyze these actions to understand user interests and determine how to drive better engagement. The executives at E-news Express are of the opinion that there has been a decline in new monthly subscribers compared to the past year because the current web page is not designed well enough in terms of the outline & recommended content to keep customers engaged long enough to make a decision to subscribe.

[Companies often analyze user responses to two variants of a product to decide which of the two variants is more effective. This experimental technique, known as A/B testing, is used to determine whether a new feature attracts users based on a chosen metric.]

Objective
The design team of the company has researched and created a new landing page that has a new outline & more relevant content shown compared to the old page. In order to test the effectiveness of the new landing page in gathering new subscribers, the Data Science team conducted an experiment by randomly selecting 100 users and dividing them equally into two groups. The existing landing page was served to the first group (control group) and the new landing page to the second group (treatment group). Data regarding the interaction of users in both groups with the two versions of the landing page was collected. Being a data scientist in E-news Express, you have been asked to explore the data and perform a statistical analysis (at a significance level of 5%) to determine the effectiveness of the new landing page in gathering new subscribers for the news portal by answering the following questions:

Do the users spend more time on the new landing page than on the existing landing page?
Does the converted status depend on the preferred language?
Is the mean time spent on the new page the same for the different language users?
  
Data Dictionary
The data contains information regarding the interaction of users in both groups with the two versions of the landing page.

user_id - Unique user ID of the person visiting the website
group - Whether the user belongs to the first group (control) or the second group (treatment)
landing_page - Whether the landing page is new or old
time_spent_on_the_page - Time (in minutes) spent by the user on the landing page
converted - Whether the user gets converted to a subscriber of the news portal or not
language_preferred - language chosen by the user to view the landing page
